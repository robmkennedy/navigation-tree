# Navigate Tree

A simple application to demonstrate using redux state handling to highlight state across components.

Clicking an item in the tree (left panel) will highlight the same item on the list (right panel).

Clicking an item on the list (right panel) will similarly highlight the corresponding item on the tree (note automatic collapsing/expanding of the tree on selection change is not yet supported).

To start the server for the json data, use the following repository [https://github.com/robmkennedy/navigation-tree-server](https://github.com/robmkennedy/navigation-tree-server)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
